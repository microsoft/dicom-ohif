# Azure DICOM service with OHIF viewer

[OHIF Viewer](https://ohif.org/) is a open source non-diagnostic DICOM viewer that uses DICOMweb API's to find and render DICOM images.

This project provides guidence on deployment of [OHIF Viewer](https://ohif.org/) on Azure and configurations needed to work with Azure Health Data Services DICOM service .

## Steps
### Create a new Azure Health Data DICOM service
- Create a [Azure Health Data services workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/healthcare-apis-quickstart).
- Create a [DICOM service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/dicom/deploy-dicom-services-in-azure). Go to the newly created resource.
- Make a note of the `Service URL` (the URL to the newly created DICOM service), it will be used in a later step.
- [Assign roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/configure-azure-rbac#assign-roles-for-the-dicom-service) to yourself or users accessing OHIF viewer to provide read write access using "DICOM Data Owner" Role.
- Set [CORS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/dicom/configure-cross-origin-resource-sharing) on DICOM service created in the previous step to allow web URL's that can access the service.


### Register an application with Microsoft Identity platform
- [Register a new application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application). Choose <b>Accounts in this organizational directory only</b> for who can access and skip Redirect URI.
- [Grant scoped permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application) to the DICOM service
    - <b>Skip</b> Certificates and secrets, since we will use delegated/on-behalf of workflow
    - <b>Grant admin consent</b> for your org to use the API. <b>Verify the green check in the diagram is checked. </b>
    - ![API permissions view with Admin consent](docs/imgs/aad-api-permission.png)
- Make a note of the `Application (client) ID`, it will be used in a later step.
- Make a note of the Azure Active Directory `Directory (tenant) ID`, it will be used in a later step. (It can also be found on the root Overview page of your Azure Active Directory. There it is listed as `Tenant ID`.)
- Leave this browser tab open, as it will be used to add a redirect URI in a later step.

### Deploy OHIF Viewer on Azure Storage Static Website 

- Click on the button to deploy a new Storage Account and configure it to host OHIF. </br> <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fdicom-ohif%2Fmain%2Ftemplates%2Fdeploy-ohif-azure.json" target="_blank"><img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton"/></a>

    Provide the following inputs:

    | Parameter | Value | Description |
    | ------------- | ----- | ----------- |
    | Subscription | user provided | Desired subsciption to host the OHIF viewer 
    | Resource Group | user provided | Desired Resource Group name. May be a new or existing.
    | Region | user provided | Desired Azure Region to host the Resource Group and Storage account website.
    | Storage Account Name | user provided | Desired name of storage account. This will appear in the OHIF URL.
    | Dicom Service Url | `Service URL` | Existing DICOM service URL (noted above) 
    | Aad Teanant Id | `Directory (tenant) ID` | Existing Azure subscription AAD Tenant Id (noted above)
    | Application Client ID  | `Application (client) ID` | Existing Application Client ID (noted above)
    | CDN Name  | user provided | Desired name for the cdn instance

- Make a note of the `cdnEndpoint` from the ARM deployment output variable. (You can find the output variables on the left-hand column, once the custom ARM template has successfully completed creating resources.)

#### Enabling OHIF Viewer on a Private Link enabled workspace
If your Dicom service is in an Azure Health Data Services workspace with private link enabled then you will need to configure a few things in the storage account created in the previous step.
- Navigate to the storage account that was created as part of the deployment of OHIF viewer from the previous step
- Add a new private endpoint (`Security + Networking` > `Networking` > `Private Endpoint Connections` > `+ Private Endpoint`) to the same vnet and subnet as your Dicom service. The target resource should be `web`.
  ![Create Private Endpoint for OHIF](docs/imgs/ohif-private-endpoint.png)
- Disable public network access (`Security + Networking` > `Networking` > `Firewalls and virtual networks` > `Private Endpoint Connections` > `Public Network Acccess` > `Disabled`)
  ![Disable Public Access for OHIF](docs/imgs/ohif-disable-public-access.png)

Once the remainder of the following steps are completed you will be able to access the OHIF viewer on a device connected to the same virtual network.


### Complete the configuration of the application created earlier
- Go back to browser tab with the AAD application created earlier (or reopen if necessary).
- [Add a redirect URI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-redirect-uri) to the OHIF viewer callback url to pass the token the web app.
    - Under Configure platforms, select the <b>Web</b> tile.
    - Specify the redirect URI to <b>https://%cdnEndpoint%/callback</b>. 
    - Select "Access tokens" and "ID tokens" flow.
    - ![Auth Redirect setup](docs/imgs/aad-auth-redirect.png)

> Note: If you receive a `Need admin approval` (as below), ensure you have green check in the Status column of of the Configured Permissions of your application. (See `Register an application with Microsoft Identity platform` section above.) In some organizations, this may require a separate, and potentially manual, process for approval.

### Test the installation
- Browse to the `cdnEndpoint` to access OHIF viewer


> You can do additional Domain and CDN configurations as need.
